## Executive Summary

Travel Guardian aims to educate and protect travelers by aggregating government and tourism travel guidelines with real experiences from other tourists and locals for every destination in the world. Users will begin by selecting a location within the webapp. Next, the user can view up-to-date travel guidelines, such as visa or vaccine requirements.
